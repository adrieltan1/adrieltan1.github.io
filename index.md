## Hi.

I'm Adriel and this is my little space on the web :)

Remember to put something more **descriptive** here in the future....

Meanwhile, check out the other things I do on the internet :)

### AXIS PROJECT

I upload videos on a semi-regular basis talking about tech. How-to's, reviews, stuff like that. 

More refined/edited stuff is on the AXIS Project channel: [youtube.com/axisprojectvideo](youtube.com/axisprojectvideo)

Vloggy/whatever happens stuff comes under extras: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWzdjp3yrrpNDfKHQXBRSw)

All about Xiaomi because they make cheap and good stuff and I like their products a bit too much: [youtube.com/miaxis](youtube.com/miaxis)

### SOCIAL

I don't really use much public social stuff but hey you are free to follow me there (what a pitch)
