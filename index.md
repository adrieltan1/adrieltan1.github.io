## Hi.

I need to put something more **descriptive** here in the future. 

Meanwhile, check out the other stuff I do on the internets

### AXIS PROJECT

A place where I upload video semi-regular basis talking about tech. How-to's, reviews, stuff like that. 

Main channel where you can find more refined/edited stuff is called AXIS Project: [youtube.com/axisprojectvideo](youtube.com/axisprojectvideo)

Vloggy/whatever happens stuff comes under extras: [link because too little subs = no custom link :(](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWzdjp3yrrpNDfKHQXBRSw)

All about Xiaomi because they make cheap and good stuff and I like their products a bit too much: [youtube.com/miaxis](youtube.com/miaxis)
