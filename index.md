## Hi.

I'm Adriel and this is my little space on the web :)

Currently a CS student. Makes videos on the internet. Projects are fun. 

Remember to put something more **descriptive** here in the future....

Meanwhile, check out the other things I do on the internet :)

### AXIS PROJECT

I upload videos on a semi-regular basis talking about tech. How-to's, reviews, stuff like that. 

More refined/edited stuff is on the AXIS Project channel: [youtube.com/axisprojectvideo](youtube.com/axisprojectvideo)

Vloggy/whatever happens stuff comes under extras: [link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZWzdjp3yrrpNDfKHQXBRSw)
